title SD2 - Turtle Keeping Track of Squares

participant Turtle
participant Maze

Maze->Turtle: 1. Requests a move
Turtle->Turtle: 2. Use Dijkstra to think up of move (Please take a look at SD-3)

note over Turtle: Turtle determines that move is MOVE, not a ROTATE

Turtle->Turtle: 3. Marks current square as "visited"
Turtle->Maze: 4. Return MOVE
