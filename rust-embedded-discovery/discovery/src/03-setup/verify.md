# Verify the installation

Let's verify that all the tools were installed correctly.

## Linux only

### Verify permissions

Connect the STM32F3DISCOVERY to your computer using an USB cable. Be sure to connect the cable to the "USB ST-LINK"
port, the USB port in the center of the edge of the board.

The STM32F3DISCOVERY should now appear as a USB device (file) in `/dev/bus/usb`. Let's find out how it got
enumerated:

``` console
lsusb | grep -i stm
```
This should result in:
``` console
$ lsusb | grep -i stm
Bus 003 Device 004: ID 0483:374b STMicroelectronics ST-LINK/V2.1
$ # ^^^        ^^^
```

In my case, the STM32F3DISCOVERY got connected to the bus #3 and got enumerated as the device #4. This means the
file `/dev/bus/usb/003/004` *is* the STM32F3DISCOVERY. Let's check its permissions:
``` console
$ ls -la /dev/bus/usb/003/004
crw-rw-rw-+ 1 root root 189, 259 Feb 28 13:32 /dev/bus/usb/003/00
```

The permissions should be `crw-rw-rw-`. If it's not ... then check your [udev
rules] and try re-loading them with:

[udev rules]: linux.md#udev-rules

``` console
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

#### For older devices with OPTIONAL USB <-> FT232 based Serial Module

Unplug the STM32F3DISCOVERY and plug the Serial module. Now, figure out what's its associated file:

``` console
$ lsusb | grep -i ft232
Bus 003 Device 005: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 Serial (UART) IC
```

In my case, it's the `/dev/bus/usb/003/005`. Now, check its permissions:

``` console
$ ls -l /dev/bus/usb/003/005
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 189, 21 Sep 13 00:00 /dev/bus/usb/003/005
```

As before, the permissions should be `crw-rw-rw-`.

## Verify OpenOCD connection

Connect the STM32F3DISCOVERY using the USB cable to the USB port in the
center of edge of the board, the one that's labeled "USB ST-LINK".

Two *red* LEDs should turn on right after connecting the USB cable to the board.

> **IMPORTANT** There is more than one hardware revision of the STM32F3DISCOVERY board. For older
> revisions, you'll need to change the "interface" argument to `-f interface/stlink-v2.cfg` (note:
> no `-1` at the end). Alternatively, older revisions can use `-f board/stm32f3discovery.cfg`
> instead of `-f interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg -f target/stm32f3x.cfg`.

### *Nix

> **FYI:** The `interface` directory is typically located in `/usr/share/openocd/scripts/`,
> which is the default location OpenOCD expects these files. If you've installed them
> somewhere else use the `-s /path/to/scripts/` option to specify your install directory.

``` console
openocd -f interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg -f target/stm32f3x.cfg
```

### Windows

Below the references to `C:\OpenOCD` is the directory where OpenOCD is installed.

``` console
openocd -s C:\OpenOCD\share\scripts -f interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg -f target/stm32f3x.cfg
```

> **NOTE** cygwin users have reported problems with the -s flag. If you run into
> that problem you can add `C:\OpenOCD\share\scripts\` directory to the parameters.

cygwin users:
``` console
openocd -f C:\OpenOCD\share\scripts\interface\stlink-v2-1.cfg -f C:\OpenOCD\share\scripts\target\stm32f3x.cfg
```

### All

OpenOCD is a service which forwards debug information from the ITM channel
to a file, `itm.txt`, as such it runs forever and does **not** return to the
terminal prompt.

The initial output of OpenOCD is something like:
``` console
Open On-Chip Debugger 0.10.0

(If you don't ... then check the [general troubleshooting] instructions.)

Also, one of the red LEDs, the one closest to the USB port, should start oscillating between red
light and green light.

That's it! It works. You can now use `Ctrl-c` to stop OpenOCD or close/kill the terminal.
